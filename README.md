# MetaWeather-iOS

Things to improve:

1)   I downloaded the image and added in app. Reason I thought was, unnecessary call to download images as all of them were static. If needed to fetch via network call - I would modify that to fetch it from API.

2)   Could have created better UI and added more information

3)  Add more test cases covering edge cases.
